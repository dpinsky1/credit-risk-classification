# credit-risk-classification

Many thnaks to Saad Khan for the help with this one. Getting the model to fly by down-grading helped.

This challenge required training a linear regression model to predict loan defaults in applicants based on data provided. The data included financial information of applicants necessary to determine loan approvals. 

Two models were trained. One with simple linear regression, and one using an oversampling method to provide a less biased sample for the model to train with. 

The model that used oversampling performed much better than the simple linear regression model.
